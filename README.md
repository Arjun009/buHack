--------
BU'hack 2020, the very first initiative by [CSE Bennett](https://www.bennett.edu.in/departments/computer-science-engineering/) students of Bennett University to host a #hackathon that will bring diversified and creatives minds from all across the country under one roof to #code, innovate, ideate, inspire one another and the community with their skills and create something new within 24 hours. BU'hack 2020's theme #code4change aims to develop the technologies that can influence the world by creating positive changes in regularity. However, #code4change does not aim to limit innovations from the computer science/coding domain only!

Help us in creating a legacy!
